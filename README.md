# MiniLab3: Array Methods 📊🔢

Welcome to the "MiniLab3: Array Methods" Java project! This lab showcases a collection of Java methods designed to manipulate and analyze arrays. Explore each method's unique functionality and test cases to ensure their accuracy.

## Methods Overview:

1. **Method 1 (`method1`):**
   - Checks if the first or last element of an array is equal to 6.
   - Returns `true` if the condition is met, `false` otherwise.

2. **Method 2 (`method2`):**
   - Combines the first elements of two arrays into a new array.
   - Returns an array containing the first element of array `a` followed by the first element of array `b`.

3. **Method 3 (`method3`):**
   - Modifies an array based on the comparison of its first and last elements.
   - Adjusts elements to specific values according to comparison results.

4. **Method 4 (`method4`):**
   - Calculates the sum of elements in an array with specific rules.
   - Adds elements until encountering the value 6, then stops adding until encountering the value 7.

## Test Cases:

The `main` method includes test cases to validate the functionality of each array method. Each test case prints the expected result and compares it to the actual result.
